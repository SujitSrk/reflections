How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
We could see which line the difference was and so corrected that line only instead of reviewing the whole code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
We can restore to any version at previous time in case of any error

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

CONS: If its manually chosen then the user may forget to commit for a long time.
PROS: the user can commit on completion of a logical change and not at any arbitrary times


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

This is because multiple files may be chnaged for fixing a certain bug or adding a certain feature and it makes sense to include all the changes required for that fix/enhancement rather than one file at a time from where we cannot restore a particular version.git 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?


git log privides a listing of all versions with their versionid
git diff provides a detailed view of all differences (addtions and deletions)  between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Very confident as everything can be restored to previous version.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
For developing Androud Applications
