When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When  people at different locations work on the same project or when I would like to publish my work for others to contribute.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I dont know


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - at github, to copy another repository and work on it
clones - locally or from github to local, as collaborator
branches - locally, for different versions
