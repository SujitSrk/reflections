What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

IT creates .git directory.  This lets git know that it will need to track some files in the directory.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can add all the files that relate to that logical change in the staging area and commit those with one commit message.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If there are current maintenance version and a future upgraded version of the same product. Branches would have snapshot 
of each release.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Very much. Shows linearity, first commit of branch, and if we have any unreachable commit.
