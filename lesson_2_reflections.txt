What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

IT creates .git directory.  This lets git know that it will need to track some files in the directory.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can add all the files that relate to that logical change in the staging area and commit those with one commit message.
