I can add all the files that relate to that logical change in the staging area and commit those with one commit message.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If there are current maintenance version and a future upgraded version of the same product. Branches would have snapshot

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Very much. Shows linearity, first commit of branch, and if we have any unreachable commit.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Merge will compare the two branches B1 and B2 
1. If in both B1 and B2: keep
2. If in B1 but not  in B2, either B2 deleted ir or it was not in version before the branch (Original versoin O). If in O then B2 deleted it, so remove. If not in O, then B1 added it, then keep
3. Same as 2 but if in B2 and not in B1- compare with O to see
